# Tweeter - The Twitter Clone
# Description
Our team - Error by Night - had the idea for our full stack project to try and recreate Twitter. We wanted to do this as a proof 
of concept and try and figure out how Twitter actually works. The app uses html, JS, node, and a database hosted on Supabase.io
that is a dedicated PSQL database. 

Users must create an account before being allowed to access the newsfeed page. Once an account is created it's stored into the 
databse and they are redirected to the login page. After logging in you are sent to the newsfeed page where you can begin making 
posts on the timeline. 

The site does feature a working dark mode but does have some more functionality that we would like to tackle. Some of that includes;
being able to comment on posts, liking posts, and viewing your profile so you can see posts you've liked and your recent posts.
